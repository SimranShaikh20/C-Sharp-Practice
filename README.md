## 🧪 Lab1: Arithmetic Series and Triangle Validation

### ✅ Problem 1: Find the nth Term in an Arithmetic Series

**Description:**  
An arithmetic series has a constant difference between consecutive terms.  
**Formula:**  
`Tₙ = a + (n - 1) * d`

**Inputs:**  
- First term (`a`)
- Common difference (`d`)
- Term number (`n`)

**Output:**  
- nth term of the series

**Purpose:**  
Understand arithmetic sequences and use of formulas in code.

---

### ✅ Problem 2: Check if Three Numbers Form an Arithmetic Series

**Description:**  
Three numbers form an arithmetic series if the difference between them is constant.  
**Condition:**  
`y - x == z - y`

**Inputs:**  
- Three numbers: x, y, z

**Output:**  
- Whether the numbers form an arithmetic series

**Purpose:**  
Reinforces logic and number relationship understanding.

---

### ✅ Problem 3: Triangle Validity and Type Check

**Description:**  
Determines if three sides can form a triangle and classifies its type.

**Validation:**  
- A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third.

**Type Determination (Using Pythagoras):**
- Right-angled: `a² + b² == c²`
- Acute: `a² + b² > c²`
- Obtuse: `a² + b² < c²`

**Inputs:**  
- Three side lengths

**Output:**  
- Validity of triangle and its type (Right, Acute, Obtuse)

**Purpose:**  
Introduce geometric concepts in programming.

## 🚗 Lab-2: Vehicle Management System

**Description:**  
A console-based Vehicle Management System managing different vehicle types:
- **LandVehicle**
- **AirVehicle**
- **WaterVehicle**

**Features:**
- Store and display vehicle details
- Calculate mileage and total distance
- Demonstrate method overriding and hiding
- Use of property and object initializers
- Add extension methods for scalability

**Purpose:**  
Practice inheritance, polymorphism, and clean architecture.

---

## 🔄 Lab-3: Delegates and Generic Program

**Description:**  
Demonstrates the use of:
- Delegates for method references
- Generic methods/classes for type-independent logic

**Purpose:**  
Build foundational understanding of advanced C# features.
