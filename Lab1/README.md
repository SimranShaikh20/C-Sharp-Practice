# Arithmetic Series and Triangle Validation

## Problem 1: Find the nth Term in an Arithmetic Series

### Description
An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms remains constant.

### Task
Given the first term (\(a\)), the common difference (\(d\)), and the term number (\(n\)), compute the \(n\)-th term using the formula:
\[ T_n = a + (n - 1) \cdot d \]

### Purpose
This helps in understanding arithmetic sequences and their mathematical formulation.

## Problem 2: Check if Three Numbers are in an Arithmetic Series

### Description
In an arithmetic series, three numbers \(x, y, z\) form a sequence if the difference between consecutive terms is constant, i.e.,
\[ y - x = z - y \]

### Task
Take three numbers as input and check if they form an arithmetic series.

### Purpose
This problem tests the ability to analyze relationships between numbers in a sequence.

## Problem 3: Check Triangle Validity and Type

### Description
A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Depending on the angles, a triangle can be classified as:

- **Right-angled**: One angle is 90° (Pythagorean theorem: \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)).
- **Acute**: All angles are less than 90° (\(a^2 + b^2 > c^2\)).
- **Obtuse**: One angle is greater than 90° (\(a^2 + b^2 < c^2\)).

### Task
Input three sides of a triangle, check if they form a valid triangle, and determine its type.

### Purpose
This problem introduces geometric concepts, including triangle inequality and angle-based classification.
